# Welcome to Modmake!

Modmake is a build system inspired by [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), but specifically tailored to Go modules. It also makes an attempt at providing a lot of the fundamental automation needs of Go projects in development.

> **This software is still early in development and pre-v1!**
> This means that the API is subject to change, and breaking changes may happen until this project reaches v1.
>
> That being said, Modmake is already in use for orchestrating non-trivial Go builds. Any feedback on the design or functionality of Modmake may be reported in a [new issue](https://github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.
> Thanks in advance! 😁
